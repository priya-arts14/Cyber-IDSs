# 🔐 AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

### Detecting Cyber Threats Using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s digital world, keeping data and networks safe is very important. This project aims to build an **AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that can spot and classify cyber attacks using **Machine Learning**.

We’ve used a **Random Forest** model that can quickly and accurately tell whether a network activity is normal or suspicious. This helps companies stay safe from hacking and other cyber threats.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10+** – Programming language
* **Flask** – Web framework to run the app
* **HTML/CSS** – For creating the website design
* **Pandas & NumPy** – For handling data
* **Scikit-learn** – For machine learning
* **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – To fix imbalance in data
* **Joblib** – To save the trained model

---

## 🧠 How the Model Works

We trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using a balanced dataset of network activity (normal + attack data).
To fix uneven classes, we used **SMOTE** technique.

The final trained model is saved as:
`random_forest_model_4_features.joblib`

## ⚙ How to Install and Run

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
conda create -n cyber_ids python=3.10
conda activate cyber_ids
git clone https://github.com/adityabhole165/Cyber-Security-Ai-Enhanced-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
cd CYBER_PROJECT
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

### Option 2: Using Python `venv`

```bash
python -m venv ids_env
# For Windows
ids_env\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux
source ids_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

> Make sure `Flask` and `scikit-learn` are installed correctly.

## 🚀 How to Run the Web App

```bash
cd CYBER_PROJECT
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and visit:
👉 **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

---

## 📊 Dataset Info

The dataset `web_attacks_balanced.csv` has examples of normal and attack traffic.
This data helps the model learn how to detect threats.

---

## 🌟 Future Plans

* Detect real-time traffic and threats
* Send alerts via email or SMS
* Show threats on a dashboard
* Try more powerful ML models like **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks**

---

## ✅ Final Words

This project shows how **AI and ML** can help protect networks from cyber threats.
With fast and accurate detection, this system helps reduce risk and improves security for organizations.
